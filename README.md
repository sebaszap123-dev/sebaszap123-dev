# üí´ About Me:
Hi! I'm Sebasti√°n.<br><br>I've been in the software industry for a while, learning a lot from many talented people. It's a field where there's always something new to discover, making it exciting every day. Here, I'll share my perspective on what I've learned and the techniques that have helped me improve my development skills‚Äîespecially since I consider myself a bit slower at coding compared to others in the field.<br><br>A bit about me:<br>I truly enjoy programming, particularly in typed languages, which is why TypeScript, Dart, and Python are among my favorites. I like leveraging the built-in typing features these languages offer. While it may take time to get used to, it's something your "future self" will definitely thank you for.<br><br>Programming is not just my profession; it's also one of my hobbies. I love building apps using Flutter with Dart. As a developer, I also enjoy watching series and movies. My childhood favorite is Wall-E, while Interstellar currently takes the top spot (you might see a pattern here). I'm fascinated by space, physics, and everything related to uncovering the universe's secrets. Fun fact: we know more about the universe than we do about the oceans on our own planet. Incredible, right?<br><br>I also enjoy gaming. Recently, I've been hooked on Cult of the Lamb, and with friends, I play Plate Up!, Overcooked, Minecraft, and other co-op titles.<br><br>üåå What I'm currently working on:<br>I'm working at Outlier and on personal projects like Safe Journal, an app I'm creating to explore PIN and biometric authentication for accessing notes. I'm brainstorming ideas for creating new, useful Dart packages to publish on pub.dev.<br><br>I'm also actively seeking a remote job where I can learn a lot, fail in a safe environment, and continue growing as a developer.<br><br>‚ùì Ask me about:<br>Feel free to ask me anything about space! If I don't know the answer, I'll gladly look it up. ;3
